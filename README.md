| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ Which teams scored **more than 60 goals** but have **less than 60 points**?                       | Filtered dataframe          |
| 2️⃣ Among teams with **no qualification**, which has the **best goal difference (GD)**?              | Single team info            |
| 3️⃣ Calculate **Win/Loss ratio** (W divided by L) and show top 3 teams                               | Sorted dataframe            |
| 4️⃣ Teams with **equal number of draws and wins**                                                    | Filtered dataframe          |
